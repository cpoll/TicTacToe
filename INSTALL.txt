Tested on Nexus7 Chrome and CSLab Firefox.



Setup:
------

- Add your session and MongoDB data to php/config.php.

- Sonar currently hard-codes some GPS values to make it easier to test.
	If you do not desire this, set the debug flag "this.debug" in js/sonar.js (line 23) to false.


Features:
---------

- Sonar: 
	Shows position of other users, relative to your position.
	Uses:
		Device GPS.
		Device Orientation (compass and portrait/landscape data).
		GPS values stored in DB.

- Game:
	Implements touch events and physics.
	Flick the images and they'll slide across the screen (using our proprietary physics engine).

- Bootstrap is used for all pages.
